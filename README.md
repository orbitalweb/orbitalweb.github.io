## "What will the web look like in 10 years?".

We believe web interfaces will start to blend with the real world, that there will be virtual actions or verbs attached to everyday objects. This is an augmented future where information is attached to place; not presented separately. One that uses natural human gestures and motions; not by poking at a screen.

To get there we see browsers differently. We see them as computational soups of many user-agents with fine-grained permissions controls, all collaborating together in filtering and sense-making. Where HTML and Javascript no longer exist but are replaced by high performance apps using near-silicon high performance assembler and direct access to the GPU and each other.
