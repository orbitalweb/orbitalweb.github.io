## "What will the web look like in 10 years?".

We believe web interfaces will start to blend with the real world, that there will be virtual actions or verbs attached to everyday objects, and that the browser as your user-agent will in some ways invert the current display architectures that we are used to. Instead of each app rendering to a separate page your user agent will arbitrate and filter many apps attempting to render to the same view. We believe this will create new challenges for accessibility and for filtering and sense-making and that this needs to be explored.
