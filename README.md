## "What will the web look like in 10 years?".
We believe web interfaces will start to blend with the real world, that there will be virtual actions or verbs attached to everyday objects. This is an augmented future where information is attached to place; not presented separately. One that uses natural human gestures and motions; not by poking at a screen.

We see web browsers not as merely engines for displaying HTML content or transient lightweight apps over the net, but rather as computational soups of many durable and persistent user-agents with fine-grained permissions controls, all collaborating and communicating together in filtering and sense-making. Where technologies like WASM can run transparently on new hardware and provide near-silicon high performance scripting.
